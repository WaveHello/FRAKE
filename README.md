# FRAKE
Frake is a set of functions for visualising results from Anura3D simulations. Currently FRAKE reads a A3D folder and orders the outputs files in an special variable type. There are mainly plotting functions, but in the future the plan is to add a python preprocessing, oricessing moitoring, and postprocessing for Anura3D.
